# **Python_CodingTest**
This is my personal notes and preparation space for future coding interviews, including class notes and coding practice.

## Overview
This repository is a collection of Python coding problems, solutions, Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb), and class notes (PDFs and PNGs) to help me prepare for coding interviews and document my learning from classes. It’s organized by days and topics, focusing on key data structures and algorithms.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (e.g., via Anaconda, pip install notebook or Google Colab)
- A PDF viewer (for notes in PDF format)
- An image viewer (for PNG files)

## Usage
- Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb): Open these in Jupyter Notebook or google colab to run code interactively, view outputs, and explore solutions.
- PDF Notes: Contain class notes, diagrams, or explanations related to the topics.
- PNG Files: Screenshots or images supplementing the notes or problems.
