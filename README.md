# **Python_CodingTest**
This is my personal notes and preparation space for future coding interviews, including class notes and coding practice.

## Overview
This repository is a collection of Python coding problems, solutions, Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb), and class notes (PDFs and PNGs) to help me prepare for coding interviews and document my learning from classes. It’s organized by days and topics, focusing on key data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure
- **(Day1) Level test, Stack**
   - basic level test problems, stack exercises, and related notes 
- **(Day2) Stack, Queue, Deque, NonLinear Structure**
   - notes covering stacks, queues, deques, and nonlinear structures basics (tree, graph)
- **(Day3) Basic Data Structure, List(array)**
   - notes on basic data structures, lists(arrays)
- **(Day4) Tree, binary tree** 
   - notes on tree, traversal of binary Tree, binary search tree, Skewed binary tree
- **(Day5) DFS, BFS** 
   - notes on DFS, BFS
- **(Day6) Greed, Dijkstra's algorithm**
   - notes on Greed algorithms: Kruskal, Prim
   - notes on Dijkstra's algorithms
   - touch of Bellman–Ford algorithm
- **(Day7) BackTracking(Subset)**
   - notes on Backtracking (subset) problems
- **(Day8) BackTracking(Subset), Sorting algorithm**
   - notes on Backtracking (subset) problems
   - notes on Sorting Algorithm
- **(Day9) Heap**
   - notes on Heap, heap example problems

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (e.g., via Anaconda, pip install notebook or google colab)
- A PDF viewer (for notes in PDF format)
- An image viewer (for PNG files)

## Usage
- Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb): Open these in Jupyter Notebook or google colab to run code interactively, view outputs, and explore solutions.
- PDF Notes: Contain class notes, diagrams, or explanations related to the topics.
- PNG Files: Screenshots or images supplementing the notes or problems.

## Topics Covered
- Stack: LIFO data structure operations and applications.
- Queue: FIFO data structure basics.
- Deque: Double-ended queue operations.
- List: Array-based operations and manipulations.
- Tree: Hierarchical data structure concepts.
- Graph: Graph theory and traversal basics.
